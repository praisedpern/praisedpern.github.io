By day I'm a JavaScript developer. [I love vim](https://github.com/praisedpern/praisedpern/tree/main/.config/nvim).

I also love riding bikes a long way. I've been fortunate enough to ride and volunteer at the [Transcontinental Race](www.transcontinental.cc) as well as regular [audax](www.audax.uk) rides, and through this I've helped to raise money for some great causes such as the [MS Society](www.mssociety.org.uk) and [Macmillan Cancer Support](www.macmillan.org.uk).
