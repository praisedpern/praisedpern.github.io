By day I'm a JavaScript developer. On the backend, I'm proficient with tools
such as node.js, PostgresQL and Express, and my frontend skills include Jekyll
and React. Some of the tools I use day-to-day are Ubuntu, Git, Bash, APT,
VSCode and Vim.

My editors of choice are VSCode and Vim.

I'm an advocate for open source software, not only for
what it can do to improve business efficiency and lower
costs, but also for helping to lower the financial barrier to
entry in the tech industry, and for extending the life of
hardware, keeping it from becoming e-waste for longer.

I also love riding bikes a long way. I've been fortunate enough to ride and volunteer at the [Transcontinental Race](www.transcontinental.cc) as well as regular [audax](www.audax.uk) rides, and through this I've helped to raise money for some great causes such as the [MS Society](www.mssociety.org.uk) and [Macmillan Cancer Support](www.macmillan.org.uk).
