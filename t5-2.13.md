### Setting up Arduino IDE

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), or from your system's package manager.

2. Download the additional libraries from [https://github.com/lewisxhe/GxEPD](https://github.com/lewisxhe/GxEPD), and extract the ZIP into a new folder in your ~\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ folder (on Linux this may be ~/Arduino/libraries).

3. Open Arduino and select Tools > Board: > Boards Manager...

4. From Boards Manager, search for esp32 and click Install.

5. Once it is installed, close Boards Manager then select Tools > Board: > ESP32
   Arduino > TTGO Lora32-OLED V1.

6. Plug the board into your PC with a USB cable and wait for any drivers to install. Go to Tools > Port: and select the COM port for your T5. If Arduino IDE can't find the port for your board, you may need to download and install the UART driver from [https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).
